# calores_burnt_prediction_model
A calories burnt prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm can accurately estimate energy expenditure during physical activities. By utilizing features like heart rate, activity type, duration, and user data (age, weight), XGBoost's gradient boosting technique enhances prediction accuracy by handling non-linear patterns efficiently.
